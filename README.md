This repo contains some Node.js challenges as well as the solutions I have implemented to them. Some of the challenges rely on deprecated libraries to complete so they have been left out of the solution set.

This project requires Node.js be installed on your machine and all solutions can be seen running using an IDE terminal or Node.js to run the appropriate project directory / src files
